# HOW TO RUN IT:
* From the terminal window change directory to wherever the server file is located and run: nodemon server.js
* From where the "Public" angular project was created, run the command: ng build --watch
* Open the browser on the  port  that the server is listening to. Example:
app.listen(8000, () => console.log("listening on port 8000"));
 
https://localhost:8000
